<p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">Zhongchong Lin, a Ph.D. in Condensed Matter Physics from Peking University and an introduced talent in Fujian Province, China, holds the position of associate professor.</p> 

<p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">We  focuses on the study of the relationship between the structure and properties of new magnetic functional materials. Utilizing key technologies from large scientific facilities such as neutron scattering and synchrotron radiation, We have made a series of original research achievements and significant advancements in the structural and magnetic studies of permanent magnets, soft magnets, and  two-dimensional magnetic compounds. We have published over 20 papers in internationally renowned journals with Citations > 300, impact factors > 200.</p>

                <li><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;"><strong>The excellent impedance matching.</strong> Upon nitrogention, the decreased permittivity combines with the increased permeability to promote impedance matching of the composites.</p></li>
                <li><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;"><strong>The high operating frequency.</strong> With the introduction of interstitial nitrogen, the ratio of out-of-plane to in-plane anisotropy field increases and together with enhanced magnetization raises the Snoek limit.</p></li>
                <li><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;"><strong>The extraordinary absorbing performance.</strong> Y2Fe16SiNy shows thinner thickness, stronger absorption, broader bandwidth, and higher working frequency compared to Y2Fe16Si-paraffin composites.</p></li>
