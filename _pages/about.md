I am growing up at Beihang Univeristy as a graduate student now in Beijing, China.

Currently, my main research interest is machine vision, based on a background in mechanical engineering. If you have any idea that you want to contact me after reviewing my homepage, I would be more than happy to receive your letter. Of course, discussing life with me is also a good choice. In fact, I am very eager to meet like-minded friends.
